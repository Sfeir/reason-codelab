- let bindings

  - the are name bindings, not variables (coz nothing varies === const)
  - redefinable - shadow former definitions

- int, float, string, char and operators

  - arthmetic, string concat

- functions (TODO - just lambdas)
- ...and to test => Js.Console.log...

  - show with log: functions are not variadic => log2
  - mention auto currying (but avoid in codelab)

* (block) scope (mention recursion problem)
* everything is an expression
* recursion

  - if/else
  - (talk about for, while, but don't show)
  - switch (just the surface)
    (code pow)

- lists / arrays
  - list, array patterns (not exhaustive when destructured)
  - show with switch

* JS interop

- how to deal with objects / prototypes
  - fast pipe, signatures

* write a calculator...
